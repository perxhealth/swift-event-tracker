# Examples

This folder contains a Swift package with example implementations demonstrating how to create custom adapters for different analytics service providers. These examples are designed as reference implementations to help you get started with integrating your own analytics platforms.

> **Note:** These examples are not production-ready. These examples are not production-ready. There is no guarantee that they will function properly.

The package includes sample implementations of adapters for popular analytics services. These examples illustrate how to conform to the adapter protocols, covering functionality like event tracking, screen tracking, and user identification.

## Exploring the Code

Each example is located under the `Sources` directory. To explore the implementation:

1. Navigate to the corresponding folder for the provider you're interested in (e.g., `Sources/AdjustAdapter`).
2. Review the implementation of the adapter.

These examples can serve as a starting point for building your own custom adapters for other analytics platforms, but you should adapt them and rigorously test before using them in a production environment.
